# Indexes

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_index):

> _A database index is a data structure that **improves the speed of data retrieval operations** on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space to maintain the index data structure. **Indexes are used to quickly locate data without having to search every row** in a database table every time said table is accessed. Indexes can be created using one or more columns of a database table, providing the basis for both **rapid random lookups and efficient access of ordered records**._
